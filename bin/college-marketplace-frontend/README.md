# USC Marketplace

Marketplace (website) for college students, similar to the free and for sale page on facebook. Intended for projects. Students create their profile, listing items for sale, such as dorm necessities, textbooks, technologies, decorations, etc. The intended purpose of this project is to enable easy exchange of items between students as people can meet up with their peers easily to make transactions. This also makes it easier to search for desirable items on the internet in a local, safe, and reliable location.
